This mod is an accurate recreation of the Sonic Origins pause menu for Sonic 3 A.I.R.

## List of features
* Multi-language support (English, Español, Français, Português (Brazil))
* Dialogs
* Themes
* Optional support for [Achievements Plus](https://github.com/fadeinside/s3air-achievements-plus), shows your coin amount on the pause menu
* Multiple Controller button sprites in the style of Sonic Origins (With the default 3 A.I.R. sprites being the default, due to them being dynamic)
